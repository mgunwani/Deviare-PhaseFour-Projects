Phase 4: Angular and Node Unit Testing Applications

	ng new angular-testing
	cd angular-testing
	ng serve
	
	Error: Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/build-angular/package.json'
	
	npm install --only=dev
	ng serve

Unit Testing in Angular:

Unit Testing:

	This testing is also known as Isolation Testing because this test small isolated peice of code. If you test uses some external resouces like network, file-system or endpoints then it is unit testing.

Functional Testing:	

	This is defined as the testing of the complete functionality of an application. Such as interacting with your application as it is running on browser just like a user would interact with it in real life such as click on a page, select a drop down, submit the form and so on. This testing is also known as e2e or End-to-End Testing.
	
------------------------------------------------------

Jasmine & Karma:

	Jasmine is a unit-testing framework.
	Karma is the test-runner that helps in running unit tests on browser.
	
	npm run test 
	ng test
	
-------------------------------------------------------

Jasmine:

	A JavaScript Testing Framework that supports a software development practice called BDD (Behavioural-Driven Development.
	
	In BDD, attempts to describe tests in a human readable format so that non-technical people can understand what is being tested.
	
Scenerio:	
	
	Calculation Component
		- Message String
		- Addition Method
			- Case 1: Adding Two Positive Numbers
			- Case 2: Adding Two Negative Numbers
			- Case 3: Adding First Positive and Second Negative Number
			- Case 4: Adding First Negative and Second Positive Number
	
Unit Testing Structure:	
	
	// Test Group
	describe('Calculation Component', () => {
		// Test Cases
		it('Test Message String', () => { })
		// Test Cases
		describe('Test Addition Method' , () => {
			// Test Cases
			it('Adding Two Positive Numbers', () => { })
			it('Adding Two Negative Numbers', () => { })
			it('Adding First Positive and Second Negative Number', () => { })
			it('Adding First Negative and Second Positive Number', () => { })
		})
	
	})

Setup and Teardown:

	Sometimes in order to test a feature we need to perform some repeated steps such as initializing the objects, cleanup activities and so on.
	
	To perform such activities, Jasmine provides setup and teardown methods:
	
	beforeAll: This function is called once, before all the specs in test suite.
	
	afterAll: This function is called once, after all the specs in test suite.
	
	beforeEach: This function is called before each test specification.
	
	afterEach: This function is called before each test specification.
